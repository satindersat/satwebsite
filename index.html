		  <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
		  <p>I am currently working as an IT Tech with Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region.  I am a recent graduate
			  of Computer Systems Technology Program.  In the past I worked as medical transcriptionist.  
			  I  also worked as Lab Information Services Helper 
			  for the upgradation of software. <br/><br/>I have an aptitude of customer service.  
			  I am a person who is always ready to learn new technology and ready to help.  
			  I am a problem solver and have strong analytical skills.  I have experience working in a variety of 
			  information technology operations and institutional settings. As Lab Information Services helper, I 
			  provided technical support to the staff members to carry out day-to-day activities 
			  and I learned about troubleshooting techniques, generating tickets, problem solving techniques, 
			  prioritizing and escalating calls when required.  <br/> Through these jobs and my diploma program, 
			  I gained excellent organizational, leadership and communication skills. Apart from being a dynamic,
			  highly motivated and result oriented individual, I understand that quality customer service is 
			  essential to a successful business and I take pride in filling that role. 
			  My ability to work as a team player, meet deadlines and go the extra mile, together with my penchant 
			  for detail have contributed to my success at Saskatchewan Polytechnic and my previous jobs. <br/> </p>
